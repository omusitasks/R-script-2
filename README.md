Data Mining Techniques(Methodology)

We have been instructed to use three data mining techniques to implement our
predictive models. The 3 selected techniques were: Multiple regression analysis,
Logistic regression and Regression tree.
Logistic Regression - we have implemeneted this technique to help in estimating
the probability of an individulas to purchase or not to purchase based on our
given Tayko dataset of independent variables. The dependent variable in our
case is Purchase variable and is bounded between 0 and 1.
Regression tree - Is a technique that identifies what combination of our dataset
factors best differentiates between individuals(who purchases/not purchases)
based on our categorical variable of interest which is (Purchase variable)
Multiple regression analysis - Is a technique that have been used to analyze the
relationship between a single dependent variable (which is Purchase variable)
and several independent variables(the predictor variables). The objective of
multiple regression analysis is to use the independent variables whose values are
known to predict the value of the single dependent value.
